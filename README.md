## INTRODUCTION
This project creates  register and login form components using  a create-react-app template from **React** and **Vite**. Currently, it does not have a backend API endpoint  that it consumes since this is purely for educational purposes of Frontend development. 
To get started with the project you can  clone via:

`git clone git@github.com:LeviScoffie/react-register-login-form.git `

To run the codebase:

You can run
`npm run dev` 






I've learnt this project's implementation through [Dave's](https://github.com/gitdagray) youtube series on React. The link to the series is [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PRCpm9clX0WiBEMB70FWwd)






# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
